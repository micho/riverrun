      intro1: "Riverrun is a computer program which makes it possible to <b>collectively write a story in real time</b> and then analyse the outcome after the event."
      intro2: "In this simple experiment, we would like you to try as a group to write a story. You will be assigned a blank line at a specific point in the story. Your job is to write one or various sentences which fit narratively with the lines written above and below yours by other participants. These lines may keep on changing, obliging you to rewrite your line so that it again becomes coherent."
      intro3: "The administrator will let you know when the story is complete."

      explain2: "The order of the lines on this page does not necessarily correspond with the actual order in the story. That's to say, you don't know the position of your line in the story, unless you are writing at the beginning or end of the story (in which case you will see that you have more lines belonging to other participants above or below)."
      explain3: "If there is no line above yours, you begin the story. If there is no line below yours, you end the story."
      explain4: Messages around you will be updated in real-time.
